Through the program, Mercy Corps is increasing agricultural productivity through targeted training and technical assistance on market-driven agricultural practices to 60 farmer groups in 60 communities (1,500 farmers). Additionally, the program is improving functioning of markets through development of sub-sector and market linkages by supporting agribusinesses and micro-enterprises and increasing access to information through market-based radio news. Mercy Corps is working with the 60 supported communities to provide access to appropriate palm oil presses promoted through a USAID project implemented by Winrock International. Any farmer who has participated in the USDA-supported producer groups has access to purchase the Freedom Mill through a cost share process.

Currently, the State of Virginia’s Mosquito Control office is raising 4,000 breeder fish that will be delivered to Haiti in about 2 months. At the hatchery, the fish multiply rapidly into millions. Gambusia fish thrive in the worst conditions imaginable and eat many times their body weight in mosquito larvae/eggs. The Haitian Red Cross will partner with OBI to provide the volunteers needed to release the fish into stagnant, mosquito-infested waters around the country. In addition to the Gambusia, OBI will also import truck mounted insecticide sprayers, 11 backpack spray units, 10 tons of spraying material and 3,600 larvacide briquettes for the purposes of this mosquito abatement program.;"";"";615;"";"";Health;"";Health;"";OBI-HT-10-010;Operation Blessing International;"";"";"";"";"";Big Busters Mosquito Abatement Program;0;2011-12-12;51;http://www.ob.org/haitiprojects/MosquitoFish.asp;2011-05-13;"";Operation Blessing International

Households are identified through community wealth rankings and other participatory methods. This program works to combat rural ultra poverty, by providing selected ultra poor families with income generating assets (goats, chickens, saplings, seeds) as well as livelihood training. Savings training is an integral aspect of this 2-year program. Household selection and livelihood training for all 1,000 households will be completed by the end of December 2010.

CRS, having vast experience in Haiti and internationally working with children and families, in collaboration with FHI (one of the world’s largest and most influential international HIV/AIDS and technical assistance organizations) and ICC (one of the leading partners of Haiti’s Ministry of Public Health and Population – MSPP in the fight against tuberculosis), works to create an innovative, integrated approach to HIV/AIDS in five of Haiti’s ten departments (Northwest, Nippes, Artibonite, South and Grande Anse). Combined, the team has significant experience delivering services in Haiti related to HIV/AIDS, TB, maternal and child health (MCH), nutrition and Livelihood. The combined technical expertise and regional knowledge of the Community Health and AIDS Mitigation Program (CHAMP) team will help guide a decentralized, department-based integrated sub-grants program that mobilizes other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) throughout the five geographic intervention areas. CHAMP will address the following issues: • Poor integration of healthcare services provided to people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and families, including MCH, nutrition, and social assistance services; • Weak participation of community members in decisions that affect their lives, including health care issues; • Lack of resources, leadership and governance at the community level; • Ineffective referral systems between service delivery points at the community level; and, • Lack of coordination between private and public health sectors and among the private health sector to avoid duplication of effort and resources. The vision of CHAMP is guided by the principles of empowerment, decentralization, and integration to create communities where families participate actively in the health care decisions that affect their lives; where a comprehensive range of services are available at the community level; and where government, NGOs, CBOs, and community members work together in dynamic and collaborative partnership to achieve common goals. Perhaps most importantly it diminishes the stigmatization so often associated with vertical HIV/AIDS programs, by drawing in a large following of non-HIV clients for other
services.

Countless others have been persecuted, pillaged and tortured. The armed conflict in the DRC is acknowledged as the deadliest war in Africa ever recorded and is regarded as one of the cruelest conflict zones for women and girls in recent history. Throughout the conflict, tens of thousands of women and girls have been raped, sexually assaulted, attacked and abducted. The Diocese of Boga is implementing a women's microfinance program serving the vulnerable mothers and children that have been either victimized or affected by the recent conflict. This population also faces discrimination and exclusion from income generating practices and are often left dependent on their husbands or family in order to survive.  The program aims to empower this population by improving their food supply, taking into account the effects the war. Included in this program, the diocese is helping rape victims acquire HIV and AIDS tests and awareness on HIV and AIDS treatment and prevention.  Alongside the rehabilitation of the population, the peace and reconciliation program aims to train clergy on methods of the peace process that will be included in their weekly sermons.  ;"";"";809;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development,Health,Peace and Security,Protection;Janette O'Neill;"";Program Officer;ERD-CD-08-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";5500;"";"";Individuals, Women, Children, Men, Staff;Diocese of Boga Core Program;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building, Food security;Diocese of Boga

The communities are in the source area for three of China's major rivers in a national nature preserve. The herders reside at high altitudes in the mountains, enduring the harsh climate with little access to basic services. The Tibetans raise yak herds for meat and butter. Women collect yak dung to heat their homes. Inside small, dark homes, yak butter is used as candle wax to dimly light the rooms at night, which is difficult on eyesight and on children who study. Residential schools do not have light in the evening for children to study by or hot water systems to maintain basic hygiene. There is little access to basic health knowledge and nutrition is poor, as the climate makes raising vegetables difficult. The program will provide solar power systems for herding families to provide clean energy to people in previously inaccessible areas.  This will allow for more productive activities, including study and livelihood activities, at night.  Local clinics will also be provided with light systems, enabling nighttime and emergency treatment for community members. Light and hot water systems will be provided to three residential schools so children can stay in their warm classroom in the evenings to learn and play. Provision of hot water will promote hygiene and child health. Ten household biogas systems will also be provided in conjunction with greenhouses to promote the growth of vegetables to improve community nutrition. The project also includes training in maternal and child health and hygiene, livelihood skills,and solar power maintenance.   ;"";"";805;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Education,Health;Nagulan Nesiah;"";Program Officer;ERD-CN-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";7505;"";"";Individuals, People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Children;Qinghai Renewable Energy Integrated Program;"";2011-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Nutrition;Amity Foundation

The project will also help the three SACCOS leverage support from other financial and technical institutions. Moshi University College of Business and Cooperative Studies (MUCOBS) will support the groups' organizational development. The project will seek to establish and strengthen linkages with the Small Enterprise Loan Facility (SELF) or other local financial institutions like PRIDE, COASCO, and CRDB, to further increase access to agricultural credit. Objectives - (1) Increased Savings and Access to Credit: In four years, the three SACCOS will have enhanced financial, managerial, mobilization and marketing capacity leading to a three-fold increase in members' savings volumes/rates, to a doubling in their ability to access external loans and to a tripling of their lending volumes. (2) Increased Production and Crop Yields: In four years, members of the three SACCOS will increase sunflower and horticultural production by 100% and incomes by 100% through enhanced access to loans to procure appropriate inputs and agricultural advisory services. ;"";"";995;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Hayley Frank;"";Regional Program Associate for Africa;LWR-TZ-09-AF-TAN-3-001-09;Lutheran World Relief;"";49235;"";"";"";Dodoma Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOS): Economic Empowerment through Sunflower and Horticultural Production and Linkage with Financial Institutions and Enterprise Development;"";2013-05-31;45;www.lwr.org;"";"";Vikonje, Ihumwa, Mtumba (VIMI) Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (SACCOS), KIBAKWE Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (SACCOS), LUHUNDWA Savings and Credit Cooperative Society (SACCOS)

The association's total membership is 172 women. Its mission is to contribute to the socio-economic development of the village through collaboration in activities aimed at reducing poverty. The projects' primary goal is to contribute to the improvement of nutrition, food security and household incomes through the processing and marketing of fonio products. It is also expected that the processing of fonio will stimulate the production of more quantities of this crop, thus contributing to increased food security in the area. The objectives of the project will be achieved through access to agricultural inputs, processing equipment and technical assistance and increased capacity to produce, process and market quality fonio in local and export markets. Objectives - (1) Increased Production in terms of Quality and Quantity: In two years, the association will have acquired high quality seeds and modern processing equipment which will allow them to increase production of quality fonio by 50%. (2) Increased Access to Credit: Access to credit from LWR's financial partner in Mali, the National Bank for Agriculture Development, will allow group members to increase their incomes through an annual commercial production and marketing of 8 tons of whitened fonio. (3) Increased Organizational and Technical Capacity: In two years, the women's Association Benkadi Ton will have acquired the necessary organizational and technical capacities to ensure long-term sustainability of this project and its benefits to members.;"";"";991;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Hayley Frank;"";Regional Program Associate for Africa;LWR-ML-08-AF-MAI-3-001-08;Lutheran World Relief;"";14247;"";"";Women farmers;Improving Women's Livelihoods through Fonio Production in Sakoiba Commune;"";2013-09-30;45;www.lwr.org;"";Capacity building;Benkadi Ton Association of Diakobougou

The Mother's Union started literacy programs in the Solomons in 1989 and since has been one of the main providers of teaching across the country, all on a voluntary basis. The courses are supported and facilitated by the Mothers Union members in each parish.  COM is part of a literacy network that has membership of 14 other organizations. At each parish there are 20-40 students in four classes - beginner and advanced in both Pidgin and English. The official figure for the Solomons is that 76% of people have some literacy but there has been no recent broad study to give an accurate figure. A recent smaller study in Malaita showed a lower literacy rate, and the figure for literacy in Vanuatu is estimated at 74%.  In this programme, the Mothers Union intends to strengthen its literacy courses in all eight Dioceses by enhancing teaching methods and developing new resources and materials for both the Diocesan coordinators and teachers. A train-the-trainer component for a core group of teachers will invest in better methods for teaching the languages. New materials will include important community topics like preventive health education, small enterprise management, and life skills.  Melanesia is economically very challenged and most income comes from overseas remittances.  Helping women to have the basic skills to maintain inventories and manage community activities will contribute to the economic stability and health of the communities.  ;"";"";829;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development,Education;Nagulan Nesiah;"";Program Officer;ERD-SB-09-003;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";1934;"";"";Individuals, Staff, Women, Youth;Melanesia Mothers Union Literacy Programme;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Church of the Province of Melanesia

Philippines;foodsecurity_site;2010-10-13;"";2010-01-01;"";mstjohn@er-d.org;Pampanga;"";"";This is a climate change adaptation and livelihood project.  More specifically, it seeks to construct a 1 square meter x 300 meters box reinforced concrete covered canal on one side of the street leading to a creek and thus complete a drainage system that will address the problem of perennial flooding in the community. It shall also establish a Livelihood Fund of P200,000, which the beneficiaries can access to enhance their various livelihood ventures. San Vicente is a barangay of Cabiao municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija, one of the provinces is what is referred to as the Central Plains. Cabiao is about 100 kms. northeast of Manila. San Vicente is its last barangay adjacent to the province of Pampanga. Hence, it is near to the Pampanga River Basin. During rainy seasons, the barangays of Cabiao nearest to Pampanga, including San Vicente, is always flooded with overflow water from the Pampanga River. The flooding has become worse in recent years when the level of precipitation has greatly increased. With no drainage system that can divert flood waters to an exit point, the flooded communities can remain submerged in water for several weeks. This has adversely affected ricefields, houses and household belongings as well as brought about diseases. The barangay is home to small-scale farmers, with average monthly household income of only P3,650. Because of the destructive flooding problem, San Vicente's inhabitants have long been clamoring for a drainage system. The barangay has started this project but after several years of lobbying with the municipal and provincial governments, it has accessed funds sufficient to construct only 100 meters of the drainage system. While this has benefitted a portion of the community, the bigger portions continue to suffer the problem. Hence, they have approached several funding partners for possible assistance. This proposed project will complete the drainage system by constructing a 300-meter extension. The project will then set up a credit facility to assist the beneficiaries in commencing or enhancing livelihood activities. The beneficiaries are presently organized under the San Vicente Farmers Association, which shall manage the proposed credit facility.;"";"";834;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Disaster Management;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-PH-10-003;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";6500;"";"";Individuals;2010 San Vicente Drainage & Livelihood Project;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Climate change, Disaster risk reduction (DRR);The Episcopal Church in the Philippines

Moving Forward addresses four main topics that capture the value of sport and play in emergency situations: health, psychosocial rehabilitation, education, and community building. Moving Forward activities are centered on youth development in four key areas: constructive communication, self-esteem, resiliency, and teamwork and trust building. The program has the following objectives:
• To work with several Master Trainers in the field of sport and youth development to develop an expanded cadre of 50 professional Haitian caregivers and teachers with the capacity to provide healthy, attentive and developmental programs for school-aged youth through participation in the Moving Forward Training of Trainers (ToT) methodology.
• To increase the resiliency, self-worth, self-agency, social inclusion and classroom performance of 1,500 youth in affected communities through participation in structured healing, and play-based activities in the Moving Forward program.
• To build a network of skilled youth workers, coaches, and educators committed to the physical and emotional well being of youth through sports, games, and play-based activities, which will meet monthly and engage in joint activities between groups.
• To organize two commemorative events: project launch on July 11, 2010 (World Cup Final) and project completion on January 12, 2010 (one year anniversary of the earthquake) with the goal of celebrating the role of youth and sports in renewing Haiti.

Heifer will help the community develop strategies to preserve and use their forests resources productively through reforestation and good use of existing forested areas. Heifer will also provide 300 families120 original families and 180 by passing on the gift30 sheep, four bovine studs, 30 milking goats, four goat studs, 30 trios of rabbits, 30 flocks of chickens, 1,440 fruit trees, tree nursery bags, and 124 training sessions.

LWR's accompaniment will also strengthen KIFISACCO's capacity as an effective institution. Objectives - (1) Increased acreage and production: By the project's end, at least 684 farmers expand their acreage to at least 10 acres and 70% of KIFISACCO members increase their maize yields by five fold, thanks to access to credit and training in advanced and efficient farming techniques. (2) Improved farmer terms of trade: Collective marketing, improved bargaining and strategic business decisions lead to a 60% increase in maize prices received by farmers.
(3) Stronger organizational, technical and managerial capacities: KIFISACCO is able to increase its capital base by 50% and its loan portfolio by 65% and forge strategic alliances with other partners.";"";"";993;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Hayley Frank;"";Regional Program Associate for Africa;LWR-TZ-07-AF-TAN-3-002-07;Lutheran World Relief;"";16456;"";"";"";Improving Maize Yield and Returns from Collective Marketing;"";2011-03-31;45;www.lwr.org;"";Capacity building;Kibaigwa Financial Services Savings and Credit Cooperative Society Limited

According to official Dominican government statistics, between 500,000-1,000,000 Haitians reside in the Dominican Republic. Only five percent have entered the country legally. Most have been denied legal status despite having resided there for many years. This vicious cycle is perpetuated by the denial of birth certificates. The Dominican government has responded with mass repatriations/deportations of Haitian immigrants. This is often carried out in violation of national and international law and accompanied by gross human rights violations. The deportees are transported by the Dominican authorities in many different crossing points: Malpasse/Jimani (west), Ounaminthe/Dajabon (North East), Belladeres /Elias Pinas (Central Plateau/East), Anse a Pitre/ Pedernales (South East). Several CBOs and FBOs in these communities have attempted to address this issue by providing Haitians with basic services and by raising awareness to decrease incidents of violence and discrimination. This project supports existing organizations and the communities of Belladere and Ounaminthe to ensure Haitian repatriates/deportees receive the care, protection, and support they need while helping to prevent and monitor abuse, exploitation, and violence.

The Burundi civil war was an armed conflict lasting from 1993 to 2005 which was the result of long standing ethnic divisions between the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes in Burundi.  The integrated development program is targeting poor rural dwellers located in all 6 dioceses of the Anglican church; the Dioceses of Matana, Makamba, Bujumbura, Gitega, Buye and Muyinga. The goal of this program is aimed at strengthening livelihoods and rehabilitating 6000 of the poorest households by creating economic opportunities through microfinance loans, specifically, but not exclusively,  to those suffering from  HIV and AIDS. The Province is also working to strengthen the food supply and increase animal production in all of the dioceses which includes establishing a networking group in order to diversify the sources of income for farmers. This is of particular importance in the north of the country, where agricultural and nutrition training must take into account the potential for disaster due to drought.  In the water and sanitation program the Province is working to provide clean water to poor communities by setting up rainwater harvest projects in schools, parishes and in rural communities.  Community programs are also addressing the needs of the returning refugees, which include peace building, nonviolent conflict reconciliation, and trauma counseling. Alongside the development programming, Episcopal Relief & Development is working to strengthen and reinforce the technical capacity of the Provincial and Diocesan development staff.

If agricultural production and income is increased, the communities will benefit from the greater economic gains, thus leading to social, economic and spiritual progress.  Introduced by a Japanese agronomist in the 1990s, Effective Microorganism (EM) technology is an environmentally friendly low-cost method of farming that allows for the production of crops without damage to the ecosystem, including effects on soil, water supplies, biodiversity or other surrounding natural resources.  The technology uses low cost and locally appropriate inputs to produce a microorganism based process for the producing organic fertilizers.  With findings of an agricultural survey, the Men's Association identified the need to provide the EM technology and innovative agricultural techniques to farmers who struggle to sustain their own farms due to increasing costs and unpredictable weather patterns.  The Association established a 6-acre demonstration farm in 2008 on donated land from one of the Association's members.  The demonstration farm uses soil from under the bamboo trees to produce EM by mixing it with molasses and rice husk.  In 2009, training subjects on biogas, using an onsite piggery, were added.  In 2010, new courses on fish ponds and economic stove will be added.  At each training, farmers will learn the improved techniques and apply them in the demonstration farm over a three-week training period in order to prepare them to use these technologies in their home farms.  In 2010, the Men's Association plans to train 80 farmers in 3 different residential training sessions.  ;"";"";802;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Nagulan Nesiah;"";Program Officer;ERD-MM-09-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";80;"";"";Farmers;Men's Association Demonstration Farm;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Men's Association (Church of the Province of Myanmar)

The components of the project are: a]  provision of farm machineries to increase income of beneficiaries by lessening rental costs; b]  establishment of nursery and reforestation of about 30 hectares of land; c]  construction of spring water system; d]  goat and pig dispersal for women's group; and, d] micro-finance to support livelihood opportunities. While sitio San Miguel is part of Digos City, it is actually a rural community of mostly hired farm workers who do not own any farm lands. There are however about 25 households who are small land-owners and who shall constitute the initial direct beneficiaries of this project.  Many of these households own  less than a hectare of land with a few having over one hectare. With these landholdings, they  can barely support themselves economically due to high cost of farm inputs and rental of farm machineries. By making available farm machineries: mud turtle, rice thresher, a hand tractor and trailer,  at lower rental costs, and by establishing a small credit facility which they can use for the purchase of inputs, the income of these farmers will substantially increase and will enable them to have a more substantial control over the agricultural production and marketing processes. The nursery is intended to propagate coffee and other agro-forest tree seedlings for reforestation of a public land, measuring about 30 hectares, much of which is presently bare, with gmelina trees scatted in some parts. By reforesting this area, the community enhances biological diversity while at the same time providing future source of additional income from coffee, rubber and other agro-forest trees. The community is presently negotiating with the Department of Agriculture for stewardship rights over this public land. [Propagation of rubber tree seedlings shall be done at the existing rubber tree plantation of St. Francis High School in North Upi, Maguindanao, which is a previous Diocesan Project.]While women are envisioned to actively participate in all the components of the project, a specific activity, which is the goat and pig dispersal, shall be managed by them in order to enhance their collective capacity to promote their sectoral interests and to empower them by making them directly responsible for raising additional household income. Finally, a potable water system shall be established to augment the present limited supply of water to the community. This water system shall also serve the nursery.";"";"";833;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Environment;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-PH-10-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";114;"";"";Individuals, Women;2010 Sitio San Miguel Community Integrated Project;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";The Episcopal Church in the Philippines

Through this program, one expatriate Program Manager and one national Program Officer are conducting assessments of camp living conditions as well as developing maps of resources that are available within neighborhoods. To help ensure that the IDPs’ needs are expressed to the appropriate actors, the RI program team shares the assessment data with the Government of Haiti (GoH), the U.N. Cluster System, international non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders. RI meets with local mayors to discuss the aggregated needs of multiple camps within their jurisdictions as well as how camp populations can be reintegrated into the community or how a neighborhood might be reconfigured to increase shelter options to IDPs. In addition, RI is establishing a system of referral pathways through which the RI team will be able to connect IDPs in need to an appropriate resource. RI’s team seeks to not only direct IDPs in need to these centers but also advocate on the behalf of these referral partners for more formal assistance. RI anticipates that the proposed program will result in long-term gains for camp populations, including greater access to protection resources, permanent shelter solutions and reintegration into community life. ;Croix-des-Bouquets,Port-au-Prince;"";1663;William H.

During the 1980's and 1990's, this area was affected by local terrorism movements. A lot of people died during that era, most of them men head of households, leaving women with no economic support. This project creates opportunities for micro entrepreneurs, mostly women,  that cannot get access to loans in the regular financial system. In addition to the loans, this program provides training and capacity building for the entrepreneurs in order to facilitate access to the mainstream economic life. The program forms community credit circles run by the group members. The members first receive workshops on leadership, self-esteem, and conflict resolution. ECLOF Peru then provides the group an initial group loan which is then sub-loaned out to each group member for income generating activities. The principal is paid back with market interest rates to the group which in turn pays the loan to ECLOF.  All group members must cover the liabilities of members who fail to pay their loans creating a community imperative for each member to comply with repayment. Successful groups pay their loans on time and are then eligible for a subsequent loan for a higher amount. Group members receive encouragement and  business counseling as they use the credit to build their businesses. ;"";"";826;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development;Karla Avila;"";Program Officer;ERD-PE-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";342;"";"";Children, Children under 5, Families, Men, Women, Staff, Youth;Income generation in Ayacucho, Peru (Mejoramiento de Ingresos de pobladores de Ayacucho);"";2011-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Ecumenical Church Loan Fund of Peru

The project will serve 4,600 original beneficiary households, primarily those that are woman-, grandparent- and child-headed households and those with chronically ill family members. Expected results of the project include improved and sustained crop yields and incomes through the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices, supporting farmer peer-support networks and the distribution of selected agricultural inputs. The project will also improve the local supply of affordable, quality seed. It will increase the productivity and integration of and income generation from local livestock, fisheries and kitchen gardens by improving community livestock management practices; distributing goats; supporting the construction, stocking and management of ponds and micro-irrigation technologies; and extension support for vegetable gardens.To achieve these results, Heifer will distribute goats to 1,150 households; distribute 13,800 food security packs and 207 simple treadle pumps to improve irrigation; establish 184 community-based agriculture and food security study circle groups; and provide training for 103 Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives staff, 138 community-based extension volunteers and 460 local seed growers";"";"";903;European Union (EU),PLAN International;"";Agriculture,Health;Geneti Nemera;"";Southern Africa Regional Director;HEFI-ZM-10-21-0145-01;Heifer International;"";31140;"";Sub-grantee;"";Integrated Agricultural Development Project;"";2011-09-30;34;www.heifer.org;"";HIV/AIDS, Nutrition;Plan International

";concern.lusaka@concern.net;Western;"";"";"Conservation Agriculture is a radically different way of crop production that avoids disturbing the soil by traditional ploughing and hand tillage. This reduces the amount of energy needed to plant crops, conserves soil moisture, reduces erosion and enables farmers to plant as soon as the rains start - guaranteeing higher yields and earlier harvests. By reducing the amount of energy required to prepare fields for planting Concern seeks to reduce women's workloads during the planting period.  Concern Worldwide has been promoting CA in Zimbabwe since 2004. In the difficult political and economic situation in Zimbabwe in 2008 there was widespread need for food aid; however the poor farmers trained by Concern in CA would have needed 50% less food aid than the control group (farmers of similar wealth using traditional farming techniques). In 2009 the CA-trained farmers were producing a surplus and so, instead of distributing food aid, Concern distributed cash to the most vulnerable poor in rural areas to enable them to buy food from the CA trained farmers. Concern Worldwide will scale-up the work in Zimbabwe by introducing CA to Malawi and Zambia, which have similar agro-ecological conditions. Concern will use the extension methodologies developed in Zimbabwe as these have proved to be highly effective. This will involve training government and NGO technical staff in the agronomy of CA so that they can provide extension services to farmers. The project will select innovative farmers willing to test CA. These farmers will be trained as Master Farmers and, when they have mastered CA, will then be responsible for training clusters of poor, mainly women, farmers. Each farmer will create a 0.25 ha CA plot, which will be used to grow maize, sorghum and a legume crop (cowpeas, groundnuts, kidney beans, and soya). Those farmers with access to draught animals (oxen, donkeys) will be taught how to use a ripper, those without will be taught to use planting basins (Zaï holes).

Clergy are trained in counseling and de-escalation of conflict, while community members are taught how to handle confrontation and disagreement using nonviolent means. Post traumatic care is integrated into all aspects of community engagement, as healing and reconciliation becomes an essential ingredient for community life after years of war and violence. In an effort to rehabilitate the communities the diocese is implementing programs that focus on the basic needs of the communities. This includes HIV and AIDS support and education groups and agricultural training programs. Due to widespread HIV and AIDS as a result of the war, as well as rampant hunger the diocese works in an integrated manner in order to address as many issues as possible in each community. The church's Mothers Union, an umbrella woman's group, has formed local solidarity units for mutual support, training and development. Education in human and economic rights is essential to ending the cycle of ignorance and discrimination that limit women's lives. The program's empowerment goals also focus specifically on women who have been traumatized by rape and other sexual violence.  Rape victims are provided with access to medical care. Advocacy at local levels also works to break the stigma suffered by victims of rape, including public testimony of victims and challenges to the legal system for accountability and justice. Finally, within the solidarity groups, women receive livelihood training and some financial support for small business development through micro credit.  ;"";"";808;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development,Health,Peace and Security,Protection;Janette O'Neill;"";Program Officer;ERD-CD-08-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";33056;"";"";Children under 5, Men, Women, Youth, Religious leaders/Clergy, Community health workers;Diocese of Katanga-Integrated Community Development Program-;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Diocese of Katanga

Seventy-one percent of its population is classified as poor, while 67 percent lacks food security. Household food insecurity and low family incomes are attributed to floods and drought, loss of livestock from endemic diseases, poor farming practices, reduced soil fertility, high cost of farming inputs and low productive capacities due to sickness and disease including HIV/AIDS. To enable households to generate sufficient food and diversify sources of income, project participants will receive training on Heifer's 12 Cornerstones, self-help group management, improved animal management, gender justice, agro-forestry, basic record keeping, human nutrition awareness and HIV/AIDS awareness, among other topics. Livelihood insecurity and vulnerability will be reduced through integrated farming systems and enterprise development services.

These families face undernourishment and anemia, which worsen in the summer months. There is no legal guarantee over their lands. They practice subsistence agriculture and are encouraged to grow sugar cane and African palm for exportation. These crops deplete the area's natural resources. This project seeks to support food security and sovereignty of 789 indigenous Q´eqchies families in this region. Each family will receive 10 pounds of native white corn, 5 pounds of black beans, a half-pound of amaranth seeds, 5 pounds of malanga, 20 chickens and 2 native roosters. Veterinary kits will also be provided. Before they receive the resources, families will receive training in sustainable agriculture and technical assistance.

Rather than dispersing sector activities across wide geographic areas, this MYAP will take a holistic and focused approach to manage risks and reduce vulnerability to food insecurity.

Agriculture and natural resource management in these watersheds will include a FFW component.  In addition to the recuperative feeding program, the MCHN feeding program will now provide supplemental family rations for all children 6-24 months.  These rations will be delivered directly to the Rally Posts.  This change increases coverage to all at risk children before their growth falters.  It also saves the mother's time and effort by bringing food closer to the target villages.  

The Haiti MYAP education component builds on CRS' experience in food-assisted education activities in the proposed MYAP-targeted watershed.  The past DAP education component was successfully evaluated and demonstrated a high level of achievement against both impact and monitoring indicators.  The strengths and lessons learned inform this MYAP.

In the context of the FFP Strategic Framework, the MYAP will reach 144,060 direct and 143,800 indirect beneficiaries in the South, South East, Nippes, and Grande Anse Departments.  Natural Resource Management (NRM) activities will protect and enhance farmers' livelihoods.  Improved farming and conservation technique will influence key factors affecting food security.  Improved access to and quality of education and health services will protect and enhance the human capabilities of primary school students, pregnant and lactating women, and vulnerable infants and children. Early warning and emergency surge capacity will improve community resiliency in accordance with Development Relief (DR) principles.

During dry season, these farms require irrigation water and the community presently relies on an irrigation canal with a length of 750 meters carved out by the community along mountainsides. As it is not paved, bank leakages and floor seepages are high and the volume of water that finally reaches the farmlands are significantly lower than what is accessed from the river source. Because of such leakages and seepages, the canal is also prone to erosion and thus it is often un-usable due to the wash-out of certain sections. With the unreliability of this irrigation canal, the cultivation of farmlands during the dry season is not maximized. The project seeks to improve this canal so that it becomes a reliable source of irrigation and thus enable the community to maximize cultivation even during the dry season. It shall widen, deepen and concretize the canal to make a 0.03 m x 0.50 m sturdy channel section to eliminate bank leakages and seepages/percolations. Such improved irrigation system will also increase the speed of water flow, increase the volume of water conveyed to the rice fields and greatly reduce maintenance works.;"";"";832;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-PH-10-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";668;"";"";Individuals;2010 Buscalan Integrated Development Project;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";The Episcopal Church in the Philippines

DBT will also support a center of technical excellence (for the technology) to further expand the supply base and provide technical support to rice millers in the supply chain who are interested in blending Ultra Rice into rice supplies.
";Swagat Foods, Daneshekar Rice Mill;"PATH is building demand for Ultra Rice in existing public-sector funded meal programs as a market entry strategy.  This approach has allowed PATH to test the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of Ultra Rice kernels, establish distribution to nutritionally vulnerable groups with little incremental cost, and cultivate demand from institutional buyers to drive economies of scale. It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor. In partnership with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), PATH launched a two-phase demonstration project to test the operational feasibility of incorporating Ultra Rice into the Naandi Foundation's centralized kitchen in Vishakhapatnam, India. There, rice fortified with Ultra Rice was blended with traditional rice at point-of-use (""wet"" blending) and was served daily to 60,000 children under the government-sponsored Mid-day Meal Scheme, which provides lunches each day to 120 million resource-poor schoolchildren throughout India. This first phase took place from 1 December 2008 to 31 March 2010. In Phase B of the pilot demonstration with GAIN and the Naandi Foundation, PATH explored alternative blending scenarios (this time: dry-blending) with Daneshekar Rice Mill, a small rice miller in Tamil Nadu. Phase B of the pilot demonstration, which lasted from 1 January 2009 to 15 May 2010, proved the operational feasibility of the dry blending method, particularly with a small rice miller.";"";"";1035;"Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)";"";Health;Amy Wales;Nutrition;Communications Specialist;PATH-IN-08-002;PATH;"";60000;"";Prime awardee (PATH) ;Micronutrient deficient schoolchildren ;Pilot Demonstration of Ultra Rice in Naandi Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Programme;"";2010-05-15;81;http://www.path.org;"";Nutrition;Naandi Foundation

Agricultural production is the main source of food for more than 85% of households in these areas and a key source of household income. However, these areas located in the southern part of the country frequently suffer from drought.  In particular southern Gaza Province has experienced reduced rainfall of 40-60%.  As a result, crops have been planted late. Building on the community networks and delivery systems established through Episcopal Relief & Development's Malaria prevention Nets for Life program with the Diocese of Lebombo, this program intends to enhance food security and nutritional diet by: 1) Improving the agricultural production techniques that are already being used in the target  communities; 2) Providing tools for the diversification of crops according to agro-climatic conditions of the areas covered by the program, as well as the need of the most vulnerable groups, such as People Living with HIV&AIDS; and 3) Increasing people's access and use of food for income generation. Specific outcomes include: 1) Increased production of food at the household level and to facilitate their marketing; 2) Increased level of community organization as well as creation of agriculture associations; 3) Increased participation and decision-making of women; and 4) Reduction of the negative effects of the environment on agricultural activities.";"";"";824;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Janette O'Neill;"";Program Officer;ERD-MZ-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";700;"";"";"";Lebombo Development Program  ;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Diocese of Lebombo

The fertile land in Walungu Territory, South Kivu will provide the foundation for launching CIFI-DRC. In agreement with local authorities, CIFI-DRC was able to acquire 90 hectares of farmland for the cultivation of crops like: onions, eggplants, cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, maize, beans and sorghum.  In addition, the animal husbandry component of CIFI-DRC will include guinea pigs, rabbits and  goats. A market study will be performed to assess other  higher-value products that could be grown (in concert with a soil analysis to determine the agro-ecological suitability of selected crops) and potential bulk buyers. ;N/A;CIFI is Women for Women International's flagship income generation program that focuses on training up to 1,000 socially excluded women per year in organic commercial integrated agriculture for sustained income generation and food security. Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ;"";"";1259;Bloomberg Family Foundation;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Grace Fisiy;"";Agribusiness Specialist;WWI-CD-10-CIFI04D;Women for Women International;"CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension agents and business development.

Many Haitians sought to travel on to the capital, Santo Domingo, to search for jobs and seek assistance in acquiring new documents that were lost in the rubble.  However, there are numerous Dominican police and military check points on the road between the border and the capital.  Since many of the displaced Haitians no longer have passports or identification, they cannot pass the checkpoints.  Therefore, six months after the earthquake, it is estimated that up to 5,000 Haitians reside in limbo on the Dominican side of the international border in the town of Jimani.  After conducting a needs assessment and community diagnostic, a project was developed to respond to the needs of the Haitian refugees.  The project is an integrated recovery program that addresses both the short-term and long-term needs of 1,500 displaced Haitians in the Jimani area concurrently in an integrated fashion of food security and health programming with education, training and microeconomic development as cross-cutting themes.;"";"";807;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development,Education,Health;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-DO-10-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";300;"";"";Refugees;Integrated Humanitarian Aid for Hatian Refugees;"";2010-12-01;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building, Food security;Iglesia Episcopal Dominicana

After middle school, the children can choose to go to El Hogar to complete three more years of general education as well as training in agriculture and animal husbandry. At the Agricultural school they learn the principles and practicalities of animal husbandry, and crop production, nuances of drip irrigation to conserve precious water, use of animal waste as manure, and composting techniques for a more productive farm in an area which earlier used slash-and-burn methods. The students share their newfound agricultural knowledge with family and rural neighbors, thereby enhancing individual farms and the community-at-large  In addition, during their time at school, these young men are helping to implement projects in five very isolated rural communities, so that the people in those communities can develop new kinds of crops and know how to market them effectively.;"";"";813;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Karla Avila;"";Program Officer;ERD-HN-06-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";100;"";"";Individuals, Youth;Agricultural School ;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;El Hogar

The project's goal is to enhance the ability of small-holder farmers to increase income levels and improve food security through intensified production, post-harvest handling and marketing of sunflower in four villages of Hogoro ward in Kongwa district of Dodoma. Objectives - (1) Enhanced organizational management and capacity:  By year four, increased organizational capacity will lead to a 50% increase in individual loans and a 50% increase in sunflower sales volumes per farmer. (2) Increased acreage and crop yields:  By year four, the timely access to credit, appropriate technologies and crop husbandry services for 585 farmers results in an increase in acreage devoted to sunflower production (at least 5 acres) and sunflower yields of 650 Kgs per acre. (3) Increased returns: By year four, the stronger bargaining position of 585 CHAMBASHO and MATUMAINI members as a result of collective marketing of their produce and strategic business decision-making leads to a 50% increase in sunflower prices.;"";"";994;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Hayley Frank;"";Regional Program Associate for Africa;LWR-TZ-08-AF-TAN-3-004-08;Lutheran World Relief;"";40221;"";"";"";Economic Empowerment of Communities in Dodoma through Sunflower Production and Marketing;"";2012-06-30;45;www.lwr.org;"";"";Chama Cha Ushirika Wa Akiba Na Mikopo Matumaini,  Chama Cha Ushirika Wa Akiba Na Mikopo - CHAMBASHO SACCOS LTD

Increased food production is possible as Zambia possesses plenty of land and water resources for agriculture and rural development.  ZAC is working to increase the agriculture productivity in order to ensure food security, income generation, and a reduction of poverty at the household level. The project is assisting communities to access farm inputs, and promoting the use of ox drawn ploughs. A practice of using local materials for poultry feed production, initiated at one of the sites last year, is being replicated at four other project sites. The number of clean water sources and sanitary facilities is being increased and irrigation projects from river sources are being developed to use the river water for the irrigation of vegetables. Water resource use will continue in a sustainable fashion while maintaining an equitable provision of adequate quantity and quality of water.  The access to formal government schools is limited and as a result many children and adults have missed the opportunity for basic education. The project works to enroll orphans and vulnerable children in community schools, and trains volunteer community adult literacy instructors and open adult learning classes. ZAC is strengthening the ability of the women and youth in the project sites to make positive changes in their lives by increasing their knowledge and skills, in order to protect them against mistreatment through economic empowerment. This includes education on HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis as well as training for mothers in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

In doing so, it will generate evidence of the best approach to do this and document the impact pathways that are most optimal. Interventions have been selected in agriculture, nutrition, health and gender equality that have a strong evidence base or, where there is no evidence base, where expert opinion endorses their use. The project will utilize the existing evidence base and improve it the where gaps exist through an appropriate project design and ongoing operations research. Empowerment of women will be a cornerstone of the approach and a key outcome of the envisioned system change, as it is well recognized that women, as food producers and primary caretakers, play a key role in influencing the nutritional outcomes in their children.

Giving people a voice and a sense of control in their own recovery and future is an important first step on the road to reducing stress and facilitating sustainable development.  Creating both cash and pride at the community level, the program methodology encourages community-based committees to identify and lead their community’s recovery projects; thus giving people the opportunity to make decisions as well as identify program participants. Program objectives are:  1) To provide immediate support toward economic independence to at least 4,768 individuals (directly), and thus an estimated 23,840 individuals/family members (indirectly), with an intentional effort to include women; 2) To restore a sense of structure, and to reduce stress and violence through the creation of 140+ Cash for Work projects that provide at least US$100 in wages/worker through 20-days of short-term work in community-identified, parish-led projects; and 3) To support the engagement of Haitians and Episcopal Parishes of the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti in community-based recovery. Some of the types of community recovery projects being identified and supported are: rubble removal; rehabilitation of local markets, clinics, schools and churches; sanitation campaigns; hurricane preparedness and response through rebuilding of roads and ditches; and special assistance for vulnerable community members.";Anse-à-Veau,Aquin,Bainet,Croix-des-Bouquets,Gonaïves,Jacmel,Jérémie,La Gonave,Lascahobas,Léogâne,Port-au-Prince,l'Arcahaie,les Cayes;"";368;Private donations;Anse-à-Galets,Anse-à-Veau,Arcahaie,Bainet,Carrefour,Cavaillon,Cayes,Chantal,Croix-des Bouquets,Delmas,Gonaïves,Grand-Goâve,Grenier,Jacmel,Jérémie,Lascahobas,Léogâne,Port-au-Prince,Thomazeau,Torbeck;Disaster Management,Economic Recovery and Development;Tammi Mott;Early Recovery;Haiti Recovery Program;ERD-HT-10-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";4889;"";"";Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable people/populations, University Students;Economic Independence & Community Recovery;0;2011-04-01;27;"";1991-12-10;Gender;Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, Centre Diocésain de Développement Intégré et de Secours (CEDDISEC)

Both groups were established in 2006 with an aim of harnessing water from Makindu River for domestic and agricultural use. LWR will accompany Neema and Makindu as they bring vulnerable populations back from the brink of starvation by providing immediate access to food and water and avoid further expansion of the crisis by increasing resiliency and effective agricultural production in drought affected areas of Eastern Kenya. Concretely, this project will increase food and water accessibility immediately for 7,500 people and their 37,500 household members through a cash-for-work program that will rehabilitate local irrigation systems. In addition, this project will avert further crisis by increasing food production in the upcoming growing seasons through improved irrigation, soil and water conservation systems and practices, stronger local management and technical skills, and access to financial services for more than 1,000 farmers in Makindu division. Objectives: (1) Objective #1:  Immediately increase food and water accessibility for 7,500 community members on the rehabilitation of Neema and Makindu river irrigation networks. (2) Increase resiliency for climate and price shocks by boosting sustainable local production and farmer income through the acquisition of needed management and technical skills and access to financial services for more than 1,000 farmers in Makindu district. (3) Strengthen the capacity of NEEMA and Makindu SHGs to implement effective crisis response and agricultural resiliency programming. ;"";"";1651;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Disaster Management;Alissa Karg;"";Africa Deputy Regional Director;LWR-KE-09-AF-KEN-3-001-10;Lutheran World Relief;"";7500;"";"";"";Back From the Brink: Rapid Response to Hunger and Lack of Resiliency in Eastern Kenya;0;2011-11-30;45;http://www.lwr.org;2011-03-17;Capacity building, Disaster risk reduction (DRR);Neema Self Help Group, Makindu Self Help Group

Objectives - (1) Improved sesame production and marketing lead to increased incomes: Access to capital, training and acquisition of necessary technology results in a 68 fold increase in production and an 18 fold increase in net incomes by project end. Organic certification increases market outlets and fetches better prices for the Federation's sesame. (2) Strengthened organizational capacities: Federation members are trained in technical and financial matters, literacy, equipment and stock management, and associative life to ensure sustainability of the project's activities. The group develops a business plan to guide future operations.
 (3) Stronger lending capacity for local financial institutions: LWR's invested loan fund increases loan sizes available to Federation members and strengthens BNDA's capacity to extend loans to marginalized groups. BNDA also strengthens its own technical and managerial capacities to serve rural communities.

Families receive a starter kit ($1,000 value) containing a floating metal cage, 2,400 baby fish and a four-month supply of fish food. Caribbean Harvest’s staff teaches the family how to raise the fish and then provides ongoing weekly oversight. In just four months, fish are fully grown and can be sold in markets. Profits earned from the sale of the fish give each family approximately $500 in addition to covering the cost of purchasing another 2,400 baby fish and four-month supply of fish food. The harvest cycle repeats almost 2.5 times a year, helping each family earn an annual income of around $1,200. This project will create over 4,000 new jobs over the next two years, with a ratio of one job per every ton of fish produced. The program will also help to increase nutrition rates in extremely impoverished villages around the lakes.;"";"";627;"";"";Agriculture;"";Food Security and Agriculture;"";OBI-HT-10-022;Operation Blessing International;"";"";"";"";"";Sustainable Fish Farms;0;2011-12-12;51;http://www.ob.org/haitiprojects/fishFarms.asp;2011-05-13;"";Operation Blessing International, Caribbean Harvest

The current political climate has left many communities unable to cope as they have in the past.  Food shortages and high inflation has left many people vulnerable and desperate for new ways to increase their income. The Diocese of Masvingo aims to improve the living standard of the poor and the vulnerable in both urban and rural centers by imparting skills for entrepreneurship development in order to increase household incomes and nutrition. The skills training will focus on unskilled and disadvantaged women and will occur in 4 centers; St. Francis (Shurugwi rural), St Peter Mutoredzanwa, Munyaradzi and St Michael (Buhera). These trainings include dressmaking, piggery, chicken rearing and peanut butter making. To further improve the living standard of the community, an integrated primary health program has been established which works to promote primary health care in communities through provision of information, education and communication (I.E.C.). The program will continue to conduct advocacy for HIV and AIDS, provide training for the care of those afflicted and participate in the NetsforLife malaria prevention partnership.";"";"";840;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development,Health;Janette O'Neill;"";Program Officer;ERD-ZW-08-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";50000;"";"";Children, Children under 5, Men, Women;Masvingo Development Program;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Diocese of Masvingo

The plight of returning refugees, of which there are more than four million in Southern Sudan, is particularly difficult.  They must rely on food aid, which often does not last to the first harvest. Recent attacks on food convoys add to their plight as well as increasing tribal violence and spillover attacks from neighboring conflicts.

Most dioceses have small gardens which can be improved through training and through the purchase of more seeds and tools. These programs aim to be simple, of a moderate scale, and relatively inexpensive in order to persist during instability and conflict.  Episcopal Relief & Development also supports the establishment of agricultural office through the hiring and training of staff. The agriculture office assists the individual dioceses with training, planning, development, and technical assistance in implementation of projects. ;"";"";831;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Janette O'Neill;"";Program Officer;ERD-SD-06-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";150000;"";"";Farmers, Staff;SUDRA Development Program;"";2011-01-01;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Episocopal Church of the Sudan

It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor.

Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes, and many became refugees in Guinea and Liberia. A lasting feature of the war were the atrocities committed by the rebels, whose trademark was to hack off the hands or feet of their victims and kidnap children to use as ""child soldiers"". As Sierra Leone works to heal after years of war, the Diocese of Bo is focusing on fostering resettlement by improving the food supply in 12 communities. The causes of chronic hunger and malnutrition are diverse in these communities and the diocese is focused on securing them a means of income and food supply. The creation of a Moringa nursery functions as both a source of food and of traditional medicine. Moringa, a drought resistant tropical tree, is a source of  quick growing leaves which have been shown to improve the weight and production of livestock as well as being suitable to prevent malnutrition and vitamin deficiency in people. The diocese is training and providing these inputs in order to increase the technical skills of these communities. The residual effects of the war and challenges of poverty have increased the vulnerability of individuals. The problem of gender inequality and violence has created unimaginable consequences and the diocese is focusing on working with communities in order to promote gender awareness and equality by holding education workshops on gender based violence at the diocesan and community levels.";"";"";827;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Protection;Danielle Tirello;"";Program Officer;ERD-SL-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";3000;"";"";Religious leaders/Clergy, Staff, Children, Children under 5, Men, Women;Sierra Leone Food Security ;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building, Gender;Diocese of Bo

The five-year project aims at improving productivity through diversified livestock and field cropping initiatives. It will attempt to reconstitute the stock of improved breed animals and high quality rain-fed seeds and seedlings of selected forage and crop trees as well as provide technical support to enhance agricultural production and productivity. This will be done through improved capacities for environmentally sound resource management.
The project targets the sub project holder GIE JALKI JEG in the village of Pethie Djeri situated in the Rural community of Diarrere in the region of Fatick. Initially the project will provide 85 reproductive age sheep (70 ewes and 10 rams.) to 35 families (2 ewes/family). The project will also initially provide 10 kilos of research quality seeds to 32 families. By the 5th year the project will pass on 2 animals of the same species to reach a total of 335 assisted families and 10 kilos of nationally certified seeds to 160 families and their 2,500 dependents.
In total 515 animals (including replacements) and 1600 kilos of certified peanut seeds will be distributed through the life of the project.";"";"";873;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Elizabth Bintliff;"";West Africa Regional Director;HEFI-SN-08-21-1701-01;Heifer International;"";559;"";"";Farmer households, Women, Youth;Diarrere Integrated Production and Market Development Project;"";2014-06-30;34;www.heifer.org;"";Gender, HIV/AIDS;Heifer Senegal

UMCOR is implementing and coordinating agricultural and food security activities with partners including the World Food Program (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Ministries of Agriculture (MoA) and Animal Resources and Fisheries (MoARF). Among its activities, UMCOR is providing agricultural seed through a system of Seed Vouchers and Fairs as well as food to farmers to help ensure that the seeds they access at seed fairs are planted and not eaten by households. UMCOR is also coordinating small livestock interventions (in partnership with FAO and the Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries) and helping farmers develop Household Nutrition Gardens to produce valuable vegetables that diversify household nutrition, decrease child malnourishment, and provide additional financial resources through the sale of excess produce.

At the request of the United Nations Special Envoy To Haiti (Bill Clinton), OBI is assessing all ten general hospitals over the next 5 months to identify the cause of the problems and offer possible solutions on a hospital-by-hospital basis. OBI is also working with Dr. Paul Farmer’s organization, Partners In Health, to bring running potable water to several other hospitals. In the first hospital OBI visited, Belladere Hospital, more than half of the pediatric patients were suffering from illnesses related to contaminated water.

Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agricultural products.

Some sources have indicated that in the Choco region, for example, there is one doctor per 10,000 people, but one soldier per 180 people.  Also, the unemployment rate is 85% and the average person makes only US$250 per year; or less than US$1 per day. Colombian society is one of the most unequal in terms of economic wealth in the world.  As a result, there is wide social and economic exclusion and huge rich to poor disparities. In the city of Cali, chronic poverty caused by social and economic exclusion and violence, has caused child malnutrition, high incidences of HIV-AIDS, family disintegration, intra-familial violence, and lack of income earning opportunities especially for women. In Quibdo, the capital of Choco, unemployed youth and street children are affected by crushing poverty, violence, and lack of economic opportunities. Great social inequality and marginalized populations of youth are easy victims of violence, prostitution, and being forced into serving with illegal armed groups. As a result and building on the church's current capacity, Episcopal Relief & Development has implemented a pilot project in partnership with the the Diocese in Colombia, to implement a microcredit project in Cali targeting women, and a youth education and training project in Quibdo, Choco.  In addition, the partnership will strengthen the church's capacity to guide and expand this program to other regions for increased impact.";"";"";806;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development,Education;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-CO-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";100;"";"";Women, Youth;Diocesan Coordination for Development Projects;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Diocese of Colombia

IRD targeted poor and vulnerable households with TSP by utilizing existing home-based care programs operated by local NGOs as distribution channels. In total, IRD reached 4637 individuals through the distribution of TSP. This included 1,045 households (2272 family members) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and 619 households (2236 family members) with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC).  IRD provided six separate soy processing and general hygiene trainings related to small-scale manufacturers (and potential manufacturers) of soy products. These trainings each lasted 1-2 days and covered a number of topics, including: (1) the value of soybeans; (2) hygiene and sanitation for food handlers; (3) hard tofu production; (4) soft tofu production; (5) fermented soybean production; (6) traditional soy sauce production; (7) soy ice cream production; and (8) improved soymilk production.  IRD provided nine businesses with targeted investments aimed at: (1) improving the hygiene and sanitation of these small-scale production operations and (2) improving the production process so as to facilitate expansion, increased profitability, and efficiency of the manufacturing operations. These investments included upgrades to the structural facilities of the production areas, such as providing roofs, and concrete walls and floors. It also included capital investments in items such as stainless steel tofu molds, cooking pots, grinders, and small generators. IRD's strategy for promoting animal husbandry has involved both training and start-up support to vulnerable households. In July 2009, IRD provided three-day animal husbandry trainings to 10 PLWHA families. Furthermore, IRD provided 9 of these individuals with five hens to begin poultry operations, as well as access to okara from partner soy businesses. As of December 2009, most of the households had expanded their operations, with many of the beneficiaries more than doubling their quantity of chickens. Only two households were identified as having fewer chickens, one of which seemed to be hit with a blight. IRD was unable to meet with two families because they had moved in search of seasonal labor. The beneficiaries of poultry raising were located in Kampong Cham and 2 districts, Kampong Siem and Kampong Cham districts.";2714;"";Prime awardee;People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), Soy-business owners;Soy Livelihood and Nutrition Initiative;"";2010-08-31;41;http://www.ird.org;"";Nutrition;International Relief & Development

Extreme soil erosion and deforestation, combined with the devastating impact of the January 12th earthquake, have resulted in Haiti having one of the most disadvantageous environments and economies in the world. Haiti faces a significant structural food deficit, and malnutrition is widespread. This agriculture and environmental program focuses on improving the food production of peasant populations through a diversified reforestation, gardening, and agro-forestry program.  In this way, the program addresses both the short-term food needs of the people and the long-term environmental needs to prevent soil erosion in mountainous areas.  Working with the farmers’ association, CODEP, in the Léogâne and Grand-Goâve communes, this program’s objectives are: 1) To promote soil stabilization through the establishment of 140 miles of hedgerow terraces on mountainsides; 2) To combat deforestation through training and planting of up to 1,000,000 trees; and 3) To improve household food diversity through the establishment of household vegetable gardens.";Léogâne;"";374;Private donations;Léogâne;Agriculture,Environment;Matthew St. John;Food Security and Agriculture;Program Officer;ERD-HT-10-008;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";3000;"";"";Farmers;Agro-forestry Program;"";2011-12-31;27;"";2010-12-10;Livelihoods;Comprehensive Development Project (CODEP)

In addition SCMS and CHAI have been working to develop a laboratory quantification tool.  This tool will permit quantification based on the units of distribution of laboratory supplies and on their aggregation into ‘testing kits’ for more simplified usage and better stock management.  The modified tool was to be ready for testing by the end of January 2010.  There are no updates at this time. Fondation Sogebank, a Global Fund PR, has asked for PFSCM to submit a proposal for the provision of services for the storage and distribution of HIV/AIDS commodities.  The intention is for PFSCM to work with Sogebank in establishing a national supply chain system for these commodities that will eventually transition to the responsibility of the Haitian Government.  In collaboration with partners, primary activities could include: forecasting and supply planning, procurement, warehousing (dedicated Sogebank facility) and training and commissioning of the facility and all associated staff, and distribution.  Currently PFSCM is procuring commodities through the VPP mechanism for Sogebank.  ;US Agency for International Development (USAID), Centers for Disease Control, Ministry of Health, National Lab, COAG, MSH/SDSH, GF;The focus of the SCMS team in Haiti is the delivery of commodities to AIDS treatment sites, strengthening systems to manage HIV/AIDS commodities and improved data quality for forecasting and supply planning.

Other activities will include provision of educational materials, support formation of school child protection clubs as well as training in business entrepreneurship skills as well as provision of capital to start Income Generating Activities.  Awareness campaigns on the needs of OVCs including their rights will be conducted with families and the broader community members including the traditional leadership. This project therefore will endeavour to provide a comprehensive OVC package and increase impact on their livelihoods. Care and support to OVC will be integrated with prevention aspects.

To fight hunger and improve food supply, IDCCS works with local farmers to increase the value of their produce and enhance market linkages. IDCCS educates farmers on improved seeds and farming techniques and works to decrease the impact of drought and flooding by introducing drought and flood resistance  methods. In order to address the high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, IDCCS integrates HIV and AIDS education into the NetsforLife malaria control program. Included in this program are the orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and AIDS. IDCCS ensures they are involved in the development process and supports the children in paying schools fees enabling them to attend school. IDCCS works to create access to clean and protected water sources.

UNICEF’s role in emergencies is to focus on ensuring the survival, development, and protection of children.  The January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti was a ""children's emergency"": of more than two million people displaced by the earthquake, nearly one million are children.

In Haiti, UNICEF plays a major role in supporting water and sanitation, child protection, education, and health interventions for displaced and vulnerable populations:
•	Cholera Response:  UNICEF works with more than 70 partners to support a nationwide cholera response and prevention effort.  UNICEF supports community and clinic treatment of cholera with oral rehydration salts and medical supplies, and works with partners and the Haitian Government to mount a massive hygiene promotion campaign, including providing supplies of Aquatabs and soap.
•	Water and Sanitation:  UNICEF continues to work with partners to cover water and sanitation needs of displaced Haitians.  UNICEF is distributing 11.5 million water purification tablets in 192 camps and under-served communities covering 251,000 people, and continues to deliver clean water to more than 182,000 people.  UNICEF is also working to re-establish and extend access to safe water through repairs to water supply systems.
•	Child Protection:  Since January 2010, the network of UNICEF-supported Child-Friendly Spaces has grown to 444 spaces serving some 100,000 children on a daily basis, with more and more spaces now operating in makeshift camps and neighborhoods.  UNICEF continues to support the Brigade de Protection des Mineurs for prevention of child trafficking, particularly on the Haiti-Dominican Republic border.
•	Education:  UNICEF reached more than 400,000 children with essential school supplies in the continuing rollout of UNICEF’s nationwide “Go To School” campaign, with 1,400 of these schools also receiving essential supplies for cholera prevention.  UNICEF also supports the construction of latrines, water supply points, and hand-washing stations for schools in Port-au-Prince.
•	Health/Nutrition:   UNICEF continues to support a network of 114 Baby-Friendly Tents and Nutrition Corners to encourage proper infant feeding practices, and supplies partners with Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) to treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.  In addition to its provision of emergency immunizations, UNICEF is a key partner in helping the Haitian Government re-launch routine immunization programs through community-based health networks.

This four month project had three components: primary care for displaced people, public health messaging to prevent communicable disease, and hospital care for more serious needs.  From late January through mid-may, the project’s teams of doctors and nurses worked in 10 camps for internally displaced people, providing vaccinations, treating minor injuries and ailments, and counseling families on preventing communicable disease.  The project also supported key public health messaging to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and hand washing to prevent potential outbreaks of communicable disease in the camps’ close quarters.  Finally, the project supported hospital care at Notre Dame de Lourdes hospital in Port-au-Prince, helping this Catholic hospital provide free care to those with more severe injuries or ailments.  Following the immediate response period, CRS transitioned to the Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) program which aims to strengthen the Catholic Health system in Haiti.  The HSS program will solidify CRS’ support for the Catholic Health system, complementing other ongoing CRS health work and enabling a comprehensive, long-term response.

The focus of the One-Village-at-a-Time program is to help the rural poor grow the food they need on their own land.  Working through the Mothers Union the project will teach the tenets of Permaculture Agriculture, a method which renews the soils and manages water resources. A demonstration garden will be set up in each identified parish and the beneficiaries will be taught together by a permaculture expert how to apply these methods.  The women will receive farm inputs and, applying the knowledge learned during trainings, will then create kitchen gardens in their own homes so they can begin to provide a variety of food and additional income for their families. The beneficiaries will also learn to care for fruit trees and animals so families can start small animal husbandry businesses. The Mothers' Union department will focus the One-Village-at-a-Time program on vulnerable women,who generally care for many AIDS orphans. The aim is to  to help feed the families in the community and to empower women by providing start up funds to undertake Permaculture Agriculture and animal husbandry businesses. This undertaking increases the abundance and quality of the food in the village, feeds the orphans, and creates micro-agriculture and animal husbandry businesses which increase the economic strength of the village.;"";"";820;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Danielle Tirello;"";Program Officer;ERD-MW-09-003;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";150;"";"";Women;Diocese of Southern Malawi Mothers Union One-Village-at-a-Time Project;"";2012-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Diocese of Southern Malawi

The project's main goal is to increase productivity among rice producers in the irrigated zone of the Niger River in Mali through a strong local certified seed production system. FARANFASI-SO will be working with stakeholders like the Institute d'Economie Rurale du Mali (IER), which will supply seeds and participatory research methodologies. Seeds will be certified through the national seeds service.  Local radio stations will also promote the use of certified seeds through regular broadcasts. Finally, FARANFASI-SO will also seek a line of credit with the Banque Nationale de Développement Agricole (BNDA) for purchase of seeds and other inputs. Objectives - (1) Increased Production: In three years, a certified rice seed production system will be established by la Fédération FARANFASI-SO to increase production of improved irrigated rice seed to 812 tons to meet at least 70% of the demand for seed among the Federation's 12,890 rice producers.
(2) Stronger Organizational Capacity: Strengthen the organizational and managerial capacities of 6 seed producers' cooperatives through trainings and supervision provided by local project staff. (3) Improved Marketing & Sales: Promote the use of certified rice seed among 7,350 federation members, to increase rice production yields by at least 30%.

The A4T students are taught two grade levels in one academic year, in an intensive curriculum approved by the government, so that female students would be catch-up on their missed education.  The school follows the national curriculum, but with a much smaller class size.  The student-teacher ratio at the school is 20:1 while in the government schools, the ratio is generally 80:1.  Originally, the Chelsetoon school provided schooling from grades 1-6, and with Episcopal Relief & Development support has been able to increase grade levels to where in 2010, the the school will operate up to grade 9.  Following new Ministry of Education regulations, A4T has obtained Ministry certification to continue classes up to grade 12.  During the first two years, the Chelsetoon Primary School was able to educate a total of 210 girls.

The program will be steadily integrated into local enterprise development institutions in order to help these organizations provide mentoring services to their clients, offer participants access to a full compliment of business development services, including access to financing, and better ensure the long-term sustainability of the program.

It has also allowed Ultra Rice to be produced at an even more affordable price for later entry into commercial markets that serve the poor.

These savings and cooperative groups have a combined total membership of over 1,500 individuals, of which 40% are women, which represent more than 17 different local villages.  This project is unique in that the implementation area spans both ward and district lines to encourage a watershed-based approach to natural resource management. Partnering with the communities within the watershed promotes collaboration which will contribute to community ownership of the project and sustainability.  LWR and its network of partners will support Mlali, Matomondo and Lumuma SACCOS to increase organizational capacity, promote sustainable natural resource management, and increase and diversify revenue sources to improve the communities' resilience to natural disasters, increase food security and improve livelihoods across the region.  Objective #1:  Increase productive use of labor, land and water to strengthen resilience to climate shocks and improve food security and rural livelihoods for more than 40,000 smallholder farmers. Objective #2:  Use draught animals to improve fertility and productivity of soil to increase crop yields of maize and sunflower to at least three times current production levels.  Objective #3: Diversify and increase producer revenue by four-fold through animal husbandry and dairy production, processing and marketing. Objective #4:  Strengthen organizational and technical capacity of SACCOS members to increase opportunities for economies of scale, and improved terms of trade among small-scale farmers.

As a result, the program produced positive impacts directly on their living conditions in rural areas, where poverty is highest. By choosing to strengthen the capacity of organic cotton producers, the cotton program fights against poverty at the root and thus contributes to poverty reduction in a sustainable manner. The program will help ensure secure revenues for producers of organic cotton and improve the quality of their lives. Direct beneficiaries are 570 administrators (men and women) who are involved in the direct management of the cooperatives. They will receive training in management, internal control and planification to improve their management and negociations skills as managers.  Thirty eight (38) Cooperative Societies of Organic Cotton Producers  (SCPCB) will be supported by the program in 2010. A total of 2,266 producers (including 27% of women) of organic cotton will be supported. On average 226 family farms will see their production improved.

Our analysis of the Millennium Development Goals' indicators have shown an unequal distribution of resources and social exclusion within Nicaragua contributing to high malnutrition rates.  The country is not on track to meet the MDGs by 2015, 80% of the entire population exists on less than US$2 per day, and close to half live below the poverty line. Building on experience gained from working in water and sanitation in the rural areas of the country, Episcopal Relief & Development sought to implement a similar program of community participation and education--however, this time focused on agriculture. Partnering with a Nicaraguan ecumenical organization, the Council of Protestant Churches of Nicaragua, Episcopal Relief & Development is training women and men small-farmers in 14 rural communities in improved agriculture techniques. The program will train volunteer agriculture promoters, who are members of the communities, who in turn will each train other promoters for a total of 168 trained individuals. Through the trained volunteers, the program will primarily disseminate improved agriculture techniques by each promoter establishing a demonstration plot by which community members are shown and learn improved techniques by doing them in their own plots. At least 1/3 of trainees must be women. In addition, a special emphasis will be on environmental preservation through the teaching of soil conservation techniques. Our goals will be to increase the caloric intake of members of 14 communities and reduce by half the proportion of children under 5 who are underweight. The program will be implemented in two regions; San Francisco Libre and Nueva Guinea.";"";"";825;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-NI-09-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";168;"";"";Farmers;Environmental Conservation and Development Project;"";2011-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Environment, Nutrition;Consejo de Iglesias Evangelicas Pro Alianza (CEPAD)

ECLOF Lanka identifies clients in the tsunami affected areas by weighing heavily on the support and information from respective local government offices. At these local government officers are personnel identified for development of income-generating livelihood programmes. These persons assist in the formation of groups / societies of women's along with the grass root level officer called  Grama Sevaka Niladhari (Village Level Officer). These government agents conduct awareness programmes in the training of various income generate projects with the assistance of social organizations and other volunteer technical consultants.

Our immediate response will be to 1) provide grants for repair of existing homes, or the construction of temporary shelters; and 2) provide livelihood recovery grants to small business owners seeking to replace materials or stock destroyed in the earthquake. The total number of beneficiaries is approximately 4,000 families (20,000 people), and will focus on communities in the area of Delmas.

In essence, Fonkoze, with the help of Mercy Corps, is turning this devastating disaster into an opportunity to innovate and test micro-insurance as a tool to help clients stabilize and rebuild their livelihoods following natural disasters. In addition to the micro-insurance payout, Fonkoze will develop and deliver a new education module on disaster risk reduction and safe home construction. During these trainings, Fonkoze will incorporate lessons about insurance as an important tool to help mitigate the negative economic impact of future natural disasters on clients and their families. Fonkoze will use the lessons learned from this pilot to refine and roll out our permanent catastrophic micro-insurance product and this new disaster training module. Grants from the American Red Cross, Citi Foundation, Seachange, and Opportunity International Germany will allow Fonkoze to scale-up the Mercy Corps-funded pilot to bring this same disaster relief and livelihoods recovery program to earthquake-affected clients in all of Fonkoze's 41 branches.;Léogâne;"";600;Private donations;Léogâne;Economic Recovery and Development;Koko Sossouvi;Early Recovery;Economic Recovery Program Manager;MC-HT-10-011;Mercy Corps;"";601;"";"";Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Affected population(s), Small business owners;Catastrophic Micro-Insurance Pilot;174;2010-11-30;50;http://www.mercycorps.org;2011-01-07;Disaster risk reduction (DRR);Mercy Corps

The program's overall goal is to improve the health and nutritional status of vulnerable groups in Battambang, particularly children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, and landmine victims and their families. This goal was chosen with reference to the latest anthropometric survey data for Cambodia indicating the decreased nutritional security of poor children under five and other vulnerable groups, especially among urban poor. The program is expected to reach approximately 7,500 direct beneficiaries.  Specific objectives are to:
1. Improve the quantity and quality of food intake among children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, landmine victims and their families.
2. Improve complementary feeding practices of mothers with children under 5 years of age through nutrition education.
3. Increase knowledge and awareness of appropriate health behaviors among mothers or caretakers of children under 5 years of age and orphans and vulnerable children.
4. Increase knowledge and awareness about dangers of landmines through Mine Risk Education sessions for parents and caretakers of orphans and vulnerable children and landmine victims.
5. Build the capacity of local NGOs to implement supplementary feeding programs that effectively integrate health & nutrition education and mine risk education.

The intervention is designed to both build on the lessons learned of IRD's past International Food Relief Partnership (IFRP) projects in Cambodia, and also respond to the latest nutritional and food security data in the region. Through the proposed distributions and accompanying health and nutrition education, this project will help alleviate the current food security crisis by improving the nutritional intake of children under 5 years of age, orphans and vulnerable children, and landmine victims and their families.  By working with local NGO partners, the project will also enhance the capacity of local partners to respond to health and nutrition needs in the province, thereby strengthening cooperation between local NGOs and communities.  ;7500;"";Prime awardee;Children under 5, People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), Landmine victims;Food for Peace (FFP): Improving Nutrition in Cambodia III;"";2010-09-30;41;http://www.ird.org;"";HIV/AIDS, Nutrition;International Relief & Development

The five-year project aims at enhancing capacities of households to revive and apply traditional collective values and solidarity schemes. They will do this in order to improve productivity through diversified livestock and field cropping initiatives. It will do so by attempting to reconstitute the stock of improved breed animals and high quality rain-fed seeds and seedlings of selected food and forage trees as well as provide technical support to enhance agricultural production and productivity by improving local capacities for environmentally sound resource management.
The project targets the sub project holder GIE Jubo Ligguey in the village of Baback Ndiongore situated in the district of Bambey.
Initially the project will provide 53 reproductive age sheep (48 ewes and 5 rams.) to 24 families. Each family receives initial placements of 2 ewes. The project will also initially provide 10 kilos of research quality seeds to an additional 32 families. In all 56 families will receive original placements while 224 families will receive POG for a total of 280 families who will benefit through this project.
By the 5th year, through the innovative POG design, the project will pass on successively 2 animals of the same species to reach a total of 120 assisted families and 10 kilos of nationally certified seeds to 160 families, involving a total of 1,960 dependents.

The SCDP program works with 10 communities within Samadi, in Bankura district, West Bengal State.  Each program initiative promotes self-sustaining, long-term economic development and improved community health.  In 2010, the program will work with small, marginalized farmers to improve their knowledge of water harvesting techniques to improve crop yield.  Artificial insemination will improve the quality of livestock available to the farming communities.  Eleven coaching centers, run by the villagers, will promote preservation of the local tribal language, Alchiki, and the importance of primary education for girls and boys.  Youth will be supported with technical education to promote small micro-businesses, further diversifying the income sources in the community.  Ongoing women's cooperatives will be strengthened by providing needed equipment, additional micro-loan capital, and skills training.  Women's empowerment lies at the heart of many program activities, including support for an all-female team of community health volunteers who work with women and children in the 10 villages to ensure safe deliveries, monitor child health and nutrition, and spread positive messages about disease prevention including HIV/AIDS. The health volunteers are backed up by the services of the Samadi clinic, which will continue to provide needed services in an area with limited access to medical facilities.   ;"";"";814;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development,Health;Karla Avila;"";Program Officer;ERD-IN-07-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";6032;"";"";Children, Youth, Farmers;Samadi Community Development Programme;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Diocese of Durgapur

In addition, the farm raises poultry (layers; future expansion will include the piloting of broilers) and bees for honey production. Oxen are also used as traction animals. Ninety hectares of a community donated land has allowed CIFI-Sudan to be one of only two commercial fresh egg and vegetable producing farms in Lakes State. The high demand for local, fresh eggs and vegetables will prove to be a substantial income generation potential for participants.

Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.

This will mean that the whole Church in Malawi will benefit from the project. These priests in turn will train their parishioners and the priests' homes will be demonstration Permaculture gardens; (3) Generate income for the college by selling surplus harvests.  These funds will help to sustain the ongoing college activities. This has begun with the building of a piggery in 2009 and will continue in 2010. This project will reach self sufficiency once the pigs are reproducing; and (4) Provide a demonstration farm for visiting priests and short trainings in order to build up their Permaculture capacities.

OBI’s international field staff has used the Lifesaver technology for two years with 100 percent success. Teams will be conducting an impact study over a 6-month period in the villages that receive the jerrycans, comparing the prevalence of water-borne illness in families who use the systems and those who do not. It is hopeful that this new technology will result in the ability to provide safe, clean drinking water to people all over the world at a fraction of the cost of other methods.

It is conceived to enable the farmers-beneficiaries to compete with the current local marketing institutions utilizing the merchandising tools available only to large institutions such as: economies of scale and value added. The project shall provide seed capital for setting up this infrastructure and shall be implemented by the Federation of Cooperatives in the Diocese of Northern Luzon [FEDCO-EDNL]. While the project is primarily intended to empower farmers-beneficiaries through their respective cooperatives to gain better control of market forces, it shall also take this opportunity to significantly campaign for environmentally sound farming practices, initially the promotion of the use of rice husk for household fuel to address the problem of rice husk accumulation and burning. With the provision of the start up capital, the project is hoped to attain a projected possible procurement share of 3,700 MT of palay or 1,850 MT per cropping at two months (60) days peak period. The project needs to dispatch 30 MT of palay or one 10 wheeler load daily during the peak period of 60 days at its main warehouse.

As an example, at the Delmas 56 camp in Port-au-Prince, Save the Children set up a health clinic and nutrition site in February 2010, where 60-80 visits take place each day.  Save the Children also continues to provide clean water, hand washing and shower facilities, and hygiene promotion for the camp and surrounding population of 6,000 people.  Since the onset of the cholera epidemic, Save the Children also set up a cholera treatment unit (CTU) in the camp.  Save the Children is currently operating 8 CTUs on a 24-hour basis at the following locations:  4 in Port-au-Prince; 2 in Jacmel; 1 in Leogane; and 1 in Maissade. Save the Children has also launched a wide-reaching public awareness initiative to increase understanding about the cause and spread of cholera, engaging in hygiene kit distribution, prevention and education activities, which include teaching families about the importance of hand washing, boiling water and seeking medical support at the first signs of illness.  In addition, Save the Children is hard at work distributing aquatabs, which when added to water eliminate the risk of cholera infection.

In terms of broader WASH activities in numerous camps, Save the Children provides a water supply system including storage bladders (15 to 30 m3) or T-tanks and tap stands depending on the population size in each camp. Chlorinated water is filled by water trucks on a daily basis in each camp in Jacmel, Port-au-Prince, and Léogâne.  A water point attendant -selected by the people’s representative in the camp - regularly monitors water supply and maintains the register, water points and storage units.  Regular cleaning of the storage units is carried out by hygiene volunteers and hygiene promoters who also conduct hygiene promotion for beneficiaries in the camps. Each person receives between 6 and 7 litres per day. Given the high cost of and dependency on water trucking particularly in Port-au-Prince and Léogâne, Save the Children is advocating for more permanent access to water and is awaiting permission to drill wells in Léogâne and Jacmel as an alternative water source.

The income generation programs work to build the skills of women in sewing and tailoring, batik (traditional cloth) making, and farming. A community run Mango plantation continues to support income generation. Beneficiaries will also be trained in the utilization of these crops in their diets to improve household nutrition. (2) The community disability rehabilitation program assists disabled community members who are blind, mentally or physically handicapped.  The program works within each community to improve their livelihoods through skills training in various trades, such as weaving and farming.

The consequences are a decrease of agricultural production, mainly in the yield of cereals and cash crops such as cotton. The Malian National Action Plan of Adaptation to CC highlights the high vulnerability of rural small farmers, who are the main beneficiaries of the program. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate and implement possible adaptation options for program beneficiaries, particularly women. Linked to this wider program, the processes of action-research are intended to support small scale rural farmers to reduce their vulnerability and to better adapt to the climate variability including extreme events and climate change. Beyond the need to understand the precise nature of this vulnerability and to make an assessment of the possible adaptation options, another challenge is ensuring that a larger number of farmers master these strategies and adaptation options and implement them in communities. Assessment will lead to better information, education and communication campaign on climate change and its adverse effects. Pilot projects will also be implemented to test the best sustainable practices for adaptation, such as the early warning systems, innovative risk-reducing community funds, and the use of the available research results. ;"";"";1027;Private donations;"";Agriculture;Josephine Lukoma;"";Program Associate;OXFA-ML-10-MAL 020 ?10;Oxfam America;"";16675;"";"";Small farmers;Capacity Building of Cotton Program Beneficiaries to Adapt to Climate Change;"";2011-12-31;80;"";"";Climate change, Disaster risk reduction (DRR);Oxfam Great Britain

The poultry production facility in Parwan Province will serve as the model for the Poultry Marketing Initiative in Nigeria. In addition to poultry, CIFI-Afghanistan has cultivated cucumbers, started an apiary, and are raising goats for dairy production. Initial market assessments have provided evidence of a strong demand for locally grown and produced products.  As the project progresses, CIFI-Afghanistan will work closely with the microfinance office of Women for Women International to provide graduate farmers with financial assistance in supporting their agricultural income generation activities.

Participants are able to select commercial integrated farming as their vocational track after receiving 3 months of core program training and understand their income generation opportunities. During their training, participants learn to integrate crop and animal husbandry and how to strategically choose marketable products to produce. Products that are selected are targeted for both local and niche/broader markets.  Highly marketable traditional crops are produced to meet local demand and less typical, preferably higher value crops, are produced that have a niche market and offer the potential to reach broader markets. The goal after three to five years is to establish a core of functioning cooperatives capable of producing and marketing high quality, high value agriculutral products.  The long-term vision of CIFI is a women-led agricultural value chain whereby women are participants in every facet of the production cycle: producers, processors, distributors, managers and owners.   ;"";"";1258;Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (DOS/PRM);"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Grace Fisiy;"";Agribusiness Specialist;WWI-AF-08-CIFI03AP;Women for Women International;"CIFI activities include: training (theory and practical) in organic commercial integrated farming; cooperative development and governance; identifying sustainable markets; linking CIFI participants to market partnerships; establishment of follow-up services including agricultural extension and business development.

In designated locations, Episcopal priests and community committees work in collaboration with local authorities (Casecs) to identify both the families in need of immediate provisional housing, as well as construction workers (skilled and unskilled).  Program staff work alongside these individuals to build the initial houses as well as train the local construction teams on the important security, durability, and utility characteristics of the CEDDISEC provisional home.  The 18.15m2 model includes a reinforced wooden frame, raised brick foundation, concrete floors, tin roofing, plywood walls, interior and exterior painting, exterior latrine and shower, and insecticide-treated bed nets.  The objectives for the current phase of the Provisional Home program are: 1) To restore a sense of physical and emotional security to 200 homeless families through the construction of one provisional home per family; 2) To improve household privacy, health, sanitation, and hygiene through the construction of an outdoor shower and latrine, and the provision of 2 insecticide-treated mosquito nets per provisional home/family; and 3) To create short-term economic independence for 500 individuals through the creation of over 42,000 hours of employment (5-6 workers for 5-7 days/home) during the construction of 200 provisional homes.";Léogâne,Port-au-Prince;"";369;Primate's World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF),Private donations;Carrefour,Grand-Goâve,Grenier,Léogâne;Shelter and Housing,Water Sanitation and Hygiene;Tammi Mott;Shelter and Non-Food Items,Water Sanitation and Hygiene;Haiti Recovery Program;ERD-HT-10-003;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";1200;"";"";Internally displaced persons (IDPs), Vulnerable people/populations;Provisional Home;"";2011-04-01;27;"";2010-12-10;Gender;Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, Centre Diocésain de Développement Intégré et de Secours (CEDDISEC)

The focus of the One-Village-at-a-Time program is to help the rural poor grow the food they need on their own land.  Working through the Mothers Union the project will teach the tenets of Permaculture Agriculture, a method which renews the soils and manages water resources. A demonstration garden will be set up in each identified parish and the beneficiaries will be taught together by a permaculture expert how to apply these methods.  The women will receive farm inputs and, applying the knowledge learned during trainings, will then create kitchen gardens in their own homes so they can begin to provide a variety of food and additional income for their families. The beneficiaries will also learn to care for fruit trees and animals so families can start small animal husbandry businesses. The Mothers' Union department will focus the One-Village-at-a-Time program on vulnerable women,who generally care for many AIDS orphans. The aim is to  to help feed the families in the community and to empower women by providing start up funds to undertake Permaculture Agriculture and animal husbandry businesses. This undertaking increases the abundance and quality of the food in the village, feeds the orphans, and creates micro-agriculture and animal husbandry businesses which increase the economic strength of the village.;"";"";819;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Economic Recovery and Development;Danielle Tirello;"";Program Officer;ERD-MW-10-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";60;"";"";Women;Diocese of Upper Shire Mothers Union One-Village-at-a-Time Project;"";2011-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Diocese of Upper Shire

In addition to being some of the poorest areas in Haiti, these departments are also some of the most impacted by urban to rural migration resulting from the earthquake.

The program utilizes a methodology of community participation, engagement and training through the Diocesan capacity of the network of newly built Anglican villages and managed by a Salvadoran Episcopal team comprised of medical, agronomy, community organizing, and engineering professionals. This program designs and implements community development projects in the reconstructed Anglican communities integrating aspects of education, primary health and agriculture. Among its many initiatives, the program addresses the health of children under 5 through health education seminars and administers basic treatment, trains volunteer community healthcare workers, conducts preventive treatment for dengue and respiratory infections, provides psychological attention to those affected by the upheaval of the civil war and gang violence, empowers and organizes communities into legal development councils, trains women in home gardening, and improves and repairs basic health infrastructure in the communities. The diversified program impacts the lives of hundreds of families in 9 communities throughout the country.;"";"";810;Private donations;"";Agriculture,Health;Matt St. John;"";Program Officer;ERD-SV-07-001;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";540;"";"";"";Integrated Community Development Program;"";2010-12-31;27;www.er-d.org;"";"";Diocese of El Salvador

The WFP-operated UN Humanitarian Air Service provided a vital link between Santo Domingo and Haiti’s main cities when they were inaccessible by road.  WFP also restored telecommunications systems for aid workers within days of the earthquake.  Moving forward WFP plans to continue assisting the government to increase its capacity to reduce food insecurity, including by contributing to the development of the agriculture sector and stimulating markets and the local economy through local purchases.

Financed by PEPFAR, AIDSRelief is a consortium effort led by CRS in partnership with the University of Maryland Institute of Human Virology (IHV), Futures Group, and the Catholic Medical Mission Board.  AIDSRelief works to improve access to HIV care and treatment, and reduce new HIV infections.  Through AIDSRelief’s network of seven faith-based local partner treatment facilities (LPTFs) in Haiti, more than 7,000 PLHIV have received care and 2,373 are currently receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Committed to the sustainability of treatment for PLHIV, AIDSRelief has been working to build local capacity to manage HIV care and treatment programs.  In line with PEPFAR’s directives, CRS  is working to transition program management to a local organization.  As the lead agency in the consortium, CRS provides overall program coordination and oversight for grant administration and compliance, as well as coordinates the representation of the grant to USG, local government and other stakeholders. CRS oversees the implementation of all project activities within an effective planning framework and manages the necessary USG financial resources for each consortium member, enabling them to carry out their work based on clear program deliverables within donor-approved funding limits.

Objective 1: Existing ART service providers (tiers 5 and selected 4) rapidly scale up delivery of quality ART.

Objective 2: The number of health care facilities (tiers 4 and 3) providing quality ART is increased and capacity at sites in tiers 1 and 2 is increased to allow initiation of ART.

Objective 3: Expand community-level services providing quality ART to vulnerable and low-income HIV-infected people.

Objective 4: Create and strengthen health care treatment networks to support capacity building within countries and communities.

The Church also has three affiliated RTC operated by individual dioceses.  The RTCs were established against the backdrop of many school dropouts from the primary & secondary education systems in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  These school dropouts do not have the necessary education or self-esteem to be functioning members in society.  The RTCs provide an avenue for some of the school dropouts to be empowered with useful knowledge, values and skills.  The RTCs do receive some financial assistance from the Governments of Solomon Island and Vanuatu.  Based on the results of a comprehensive review and study of the RTCs conducted in 2009 by Episcopal Relief & Developmentand ACOM, five policy goals have been identified:  1) to increase the number of female students and lower the ratio differential between men and women in all 9 schools; 2) to increase and/or improve the number of business and management courses; 3) To initiate or expand short community courses as a means of increasing impact and nonformal education access; 4) to develop business plans for at least 4 RTCs which result in increasing the income and self sustainability of the individual RTCs; and 5) introducing solar power as both a course and a source of revenue for the school.  The program will be overseen by a Business Development Committee which will function for 2 years. Loans and seed funds for reviewed and accepted  business plans will be made available as part of the 2011 program.  The program will measure impact of business development plans and solar energy course on the self sustainability of the RTCs.";"";"";828;Private donations;"";Economic Recovery and Development,Education;Nagulan Nesiah;"";Program Officer;ERD-SB-09-002;Episcopal Relief & Development;"";746;"";"";Individuals, Staff, Women, Youth;Building ACOM Rural Training Centre Sustainability;"";2011-12-30;27;www.er-d.org;"";Capacity building;Church of the Province of Melanesia

Lack of employment opportunities is a big issue among the members in this community. Most of the men and women remaining are unemployed, the rest are working illegally in the USA because that is their only resource. Episcopal Relief & Development in partnership with the Diocese of Southeast Mexico established a dairy cooperative to generate income and employment among the members of this community. Cattle has being purchase to form a cooperative among the members of the community. They organized themselves to work the land where cattle is raised, they make sure it has adequate space, food and provide maintenance on a regular basis. A veterinarian has been hired to train the members of the cooperative on how to maintain and take care of the cattle, how to apply vaccines and other medications to the animals and to monitor their health on a regular basis. Training on milk production, cheese making and basic business practices are also provided to guarantee their insertion into the local markets.

As WHI has observed significant decrease of cholera incidence in the areas deserved, emphasis are now preferentially placed on awareness, education on hygiene and sanitation as well provision of hygiene materials to the vulnerable populations.

World Hope International established three cholera treatment units where clients receive basic medical treatment with full medical staff including a doctor, nurse and auxiliary nurse.  The clinics are located in Artibonite (Ennery and Saint Michel de l’Attalaye), the source of the outbreak, and Ouest (Mais Gate).  WHI provides intermediate level of cholera care by first rehydrating the patients and depending on severity, providing zinc and antibiotics before referring patients to a cholera treatment center.  At the centre, the patient can receive more in-patient support from other humanitarian partners.

Since the initiation of the project, WHI has reached over 4,298 patients with basic care and prevention education and treated 29 patients with cholera at the cholera treatment unit.  WHI also conducts mobile clinic in the areas where WHI reached 620 additional patients.  World Hope International expects to serve over 15,000 people per month until the crisis abates.

WHI is also addressing prevention by training ten field health agents to educate communities on hygiene and cholera prevention.  Five agents are assigned to each clinic.  Hand washing stations (as pictured below) are set up in each unit to teach children and others about the importance of hygiene.";Gonaïves,Port-au-Prince;"";755;Private donations;Carrefour,Delmas,Ennery,Port-au-Prince;Health;Larousse Ceus;Health;Country Director of Haiti;WH-HT-10-011;World Hope International;"";15000;"";Prime awardee;Cholera affected population, People in camps, People living in remote areas;Cholera Treatment Units/Awareness;200000;2011-12-31;73;http://www.worldhope.org;2011-04-26;"";World Hope International, Fondation Bon Samaritain AMJ-JS
