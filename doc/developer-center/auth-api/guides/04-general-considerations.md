## General Considerations

- Regenerate a regular/master API Key if you suspect it has being compromised. A regenerated API Key grants the same permissions as before, but has a new code/token. Maps/apps using a regenerated API Key must be updated to adapt to that change, otherwise they will stop working. 
- Send always an API Key in your API requests 
- Issue a new regular API Key per map/app. Try to avoid sharing keys between maps/apps 
- Grant the least amount of necessary permissions per API Key 
- Use the Master API Key sparingly 
- Keep your Master API Key secret! 
- Do not overuse the Default Public API Key. Itâ€™s meant for obviously public Datasets.
