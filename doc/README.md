Reference pages are documented using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (The following [Swagger editor]( https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/) can be useful to test new content)

Changes of updates in this files are periodically fetched and updated in [Developer Center site](https://carto.com/developers/). Find some editing guidelines [here](https://github.com/CartoDB/developers/wiki/Editing-and-contributing-guidelines).
